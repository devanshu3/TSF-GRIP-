# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
Use R or Python or perform this task.

# Task-3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

# Task-4 : Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis (Level - Advanced)

Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
Stock to analyze and predict SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model.
