## Decision Tree Algorithm for Flower Classification

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of the Decision Tree algorithm for flower classification. We will use the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning, to train a Decision Tree model that can classify different species of flowers based on their features.

## Contents
This project contains the following key steps:

*Importing the Required Libraries:* Importing essential Python libraries and modules for data handling, visualization, and machine learning.

*Loading the Dataset:* Loading the Iris dataset, which is commonly used for machine learning and classification tasks.

*Exploratory Data Analysis:* Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the data's structure and characteristics.

*Data Visualization:* Creating visualizations, including scatter plots, to better understand the relationships between the features and the flower species.

*Decision Tree Model Training:* Splitting the data into training and testing sets, and training a Decision Tree classifier on the training data.

*Visualizing the Trained Model:* Generating and visualizing the Decision Tree model to understand its decision-making process.

*Predicting Flower Class:* Using the trained model to predict the class of a flower based on its petal and sepal measurements.

*Calculating Model Accuracy:* Evaluating the model's accuracy on the test data to measure its performance.

## Usage
To run this code, ensure you have the required libraries installed in your Python environment. You can execute the code step by step, and make sure that the file paths for exporting and displaying the decision tree image are correctly set.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the use of the Decision Tree algorithm for flower classification, providing valuable insights into the training process and model evaluation. The model can be used for classifying iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal measurements.
